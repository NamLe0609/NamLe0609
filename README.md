### Hi there ðŸ˜„

Im Nam Le, a Vietnamese Performance Engineer living in the UK for the past ~7 years. I am currently studying Computer Science at [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/). 
I just finished my 2nd year of my integrated Masters degree (MEng), and will be participating in the [JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc) Guest Student Programme, as well as [SecureWorks](https://www.secureworks.com/) internship programme in summer 2024.

## Professional Interests

> We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

I live by the principles of writing fast, efficient, and hardware-friendly software, as I believe this is how one grows most as a software engineer. My research and career interests naturally reflects this principle.

### Research

- High Performance Computing
- GPU and Parallel programming
- Compiler optimization and Data Oriented Design
  
### Career

- Quantitative developer
- Low-latency programming
- Performance engineering

## About me

I always push my self to my utmost limit in everything I do, be it playing games or studying. It is therefore not surprising why my main interest in the field of Computer Science is with Performance Engineering ðŸ˜…. 
In my free time, I usually enjoy reading classics/dystopian/sci-fi novels, or participate in lengthy (and nerdy ðŸ¤“) conversations with my university peers on various topics.
