Im Nam Le, an Vietnamese developer living in the UK for the past 6 years. I am currently studying Computer Science at [Durham University](https://durham.ac.uk/), England, UK. I am currently a 2nd year student looking for a summer internship to expand my knowledge and experience in any field of Computer Science in 2024.

## About me

I really enjoy learning about new technologies as well as coding language, especially whenever I have to do so for a challenging project. Outside of programming, in my free time, I usually enjoy reading classics, dystopian or sci-fi novels, or sometimes I like cooking good food.
